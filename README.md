# 🌍 Geography Question Tester

## 📖 Overview

The **Geography Question Tester** is a C# application designed to test users' knowledge of geography through a series of questions. This tool is ideal for students. This is no longer a developed app but it was cool to learn about different programming techniques and technologies like windows forms. This was made when I was 16-17 so probably not the best code.
